# UltraHardcore Minecraft Plugin (Pietsmiet Edition)

When the plugin is enabled Players will no longer 
regenerate health naturally. Instead they have to 
eat golden food like `Golden Carrots` or `Golden Apples`
they will (by default) regenerate a small amount 
of your health.
`Entchanted Golden Apples` will regenerate your whole health.
The amount, of how much a food will regenerate your health, 
is configurable.
