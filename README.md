# UltraHardcore Minecraft Plugin (Pietsmiet Edition)

---
### What does this plugin?
When the plugin is enabled Players will no longer regenerate health naturally. Instead a Player will have to eat golden
food like `Golden Carrots` or
`Golden Apples`they will (by default) regenerate a small amount of your health.
`Entchanted Golden Apples` will regenerate your whole health. The amount, of how much a food will regenerate your
health, is configurable.

### Configuration
You can add and remove Types of Food by editing the [Config.yml](config.yml) you can configure how much the food should
be able to regenerate.
